# GoogleAnalytics

## Setup

1. To submit data to Google Analytics you need to set your [Google Analytics Tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032385?hl) in the configuration of this plugin.
2. Include the Google Analytics Tracking Code in your layout plugin by linking the provided content to a suitable layout container. The choice of the layout container determines which pages will be tracked by the Google Analytics plugin.
If you are using **Ceres** for your online store layout, we recommend to assign this plugin to the provided container **Template.Style**.
3. The checkbox **Anonymize IPs** determines, whether IPs are transmitted to Google in an anonymised fashion. This option is active by default.
