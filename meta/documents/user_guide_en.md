# GoogleAnalytics

## Setup

1. To submit data to Google Analytics you need to set your [Google Analytics Tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032385?hl) in the configuration of this plugin.
2. Include the Google Analytics Tracking Code in your layout plugin by linking the provided content to a suitable layout container. The choice of the layout container determines which pages will be tracked by the Google Analytics plugin.
If you are using **plentyShop LTS** for your online store layout, we recommend to assign this plugin to the provided container **Template.Style**.
3. The checkbox **Anonymize IPs** determines, whether IPs are transmitted to Google in an anonymised fashion. This option is active by default.

 When using Google Analytics, you are obliged to inform visitors about the type of use of the data. We would like to point out that when using services that transfer personal data to a third country (e.g. USA), the conditions for permissible data transfer according to Art. 44 ff GDPR must be met.
